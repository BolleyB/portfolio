            <p>Dear Reader,</p>

            <p>
              I am writing to express my interest in opportunities within <em>Full Stack Development</em> and <em>AI/ML engineering</em>. 
              With over five years of experience in software development, combined with my U.S. Army background in system administration and cybersecurity, 
              I have developed the technical depth and problem-solving skills to thrive in complex, mission-critical environments.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my current role at SponsorForce, I have engineered scalable chatbot solutions using <strong>React, FastAPI, and Redis</strong>, 
              deployed through modern CI/CD pipelines. I designed reusable components and optimized distributed system performance, 
              improving real-time engagement and reliability. My prior experience at Mailchimp and Upwork further strengthened my expertise in 
              <strong>RESTful APIs, data-driven applications, and user-focused design</strong>. These experiences reflect my ability to build solutions that 
              are both technically sound and highly impactful.
            </p>

            <p>
              Beyond full stack development, I am deeply interested in <mark>AI/ML applications</mark>. I have worked with technologies such as 
              <strong>LangChain, LlamaIndex, TensorFlow, and AWS AI services</strong> to design intelligent systems that enhance user interaction, 
              automate workflows, and enable smarter decision-making. I am currently pursuing a <strong>B.S. in Computer Science at Western Governors University (expected graduation May 2027)</strong>, 
              expanding my academic foundation while applying my skills to real-world projects.
            </p>

            <p>
              My long-term goal is to contribute to projects that combine <em>full stack engineering, cloud-native development, and AI-driven solutions</em> 
              to transform industries and improve lives. I am motivated by opportunities where innovation meets purpose, and I am eager to bring my 
              technical expertise, leadership experience, and passion for emerging technologies to a forward-thinking team.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thank you for reviewing my portfolio. I would welcome the opportunity to connect and discuss how my background and goals align with your organizationâ€™s vision.
            </p>

            <p>Sincerely,<br><strong>Hugo Bolivar Webster III</strong></p>
